# MyDailyPlanner
A professional planner created to help balance busy week events.

The planner uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Moment JS and Font Awesome to create an interactive day planner for the work day.

The planner displays the current date and is running on current time with MomentJS.

The timeblock containers were created using Bootstrap.

Jquery and JavaScript allow this day planner to be interactive by allowing the user to enter events or meetings into the hour sections, storing hourly events in local storage, keeping event descriptions on the screen after refresh.

CSS provides more detialed styling to the site and displays the color coded hour blocks.
